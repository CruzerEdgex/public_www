My name is Cristian Urbina. I got my licentiate degree at University of Santiago of Chile and I'm currently doing a PhD. in Computer Science at University of Chile.

My main interests for research are:

* Combinatorics on words
* Compressibility and repetitiveness measures
* Formal languages

Feel free to contact me if you want to talk about any of this topics. I really like to discuss about them.
